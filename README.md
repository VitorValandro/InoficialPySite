# Unofficial Imagine Dragons Webpage

This project was done as my first design work for the discipline of Web Development I in 2019. It consists of stylized static pages with a original UI and UX design.

## Pages and screens

- Homepage: introduces the band and its members;
- História (History): tells about the history of the band;
- Discos (Albums): shows the band's albums with a preview of the main track  and spotify link;
- Prêmios (Awards): a timeline (carousel style) with all the band's awards;
- Shows: a static page that shows in a modal style information of all the band's music shows, like date and time of the event and a google maps localization;
- Quiz: a simples quiz to test knowledge about the band. All information to answer the quiz is on the website.

## CSS Tricks used:
- Slides and carousels;
- Modal boxes;
- Beautiful icons;
- A lot of hovers and animations;

### Project finished and closed
The website have a lot of CSS bugs, mainly of element dimension and position control. Why not fix it and improve? Because this website has my first real work of design and stylization with CSS and it is a mark of my evolution as a front-end developer.
